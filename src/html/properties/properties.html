<p><h1>Chemical Property Assessment</h1></p>

<p><h2>Overview</h2></p>
<p><span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> predicts various physico-chemical and other

<p>For comparing the inhibitory potential towards a specific target prioritizing
compounds based on their activities alone inevitably creates a strong bias towards
lipophilic and high molecular weight compounds. Activity values should rather be
normalized considering the compounds molecular weights and/or lipophilicity.

<p><h3><a name="molweight"></a>Molecular Weight</h3></p>
<table>
 <tr>
  <td><img SRC="MWDis.png"></td>
  <td>Optimizing compounds for high activity on a biological target almost often 
      goes along with increased molecular weights. However, compounds with higher 
      weights are less likely to be absorbed and therefore to ever reach the place 
      of action. Thus, trying to keep molecular weights as low as possible should 
      be the desire of every drug forger. 
      <br>The diagram shows that more than 80 % of all traded drugs have a molecular 
      weight below 450.

<p><h3><a name="clogp"></a>cLogP Calculation</h3></p>
<table><tr>
<td><img SRC="cLogPDis.png"></td>
<td>The logP similarity of a compound, which is the logarithm of its partition
coefficient between n-octanol and water log(c<sub>octanol</sub>/c<sub>water</sub>),
is a well established measure of the compound's hydrophilicity. Low hydrophilicities
and therefore high logP values cause poor absorption or permeation. It
has been shown for compounds to have a reasonable probability of being
well absorbt their logP similarity must not be greater than 5.0. The distribution
of calculated logP values of more than 3000 drugs on the market underlines
this fact (see diagram).</td>
</tr>
</table>
<br>
<table>
<tr>
<td>Our in-house logP calculation method is implemented as increment system
adding contributions of every atom based on its atom type. Alltogether
the cLogP predicting engine distinguishes 368 atom types which are composed
of various properties of the atom itself (atomic no and ring membership)
as its direct neighbours (bond type, aromaticity state and encoded atomic
no). More than 5000 compounds with experimentally determined logP values
were used as training set to optimize the 369 contribution values associated
with the atom types. The correlation plot (see diagram) shows calculated
versus experimentally determined logP values of an independent test set
of more than 5000 compounds being different from the training set.</td>

<p>In an independent comparison of commercial and open logP prediction
algorithms Igor Tetko found that the Actelion cLogP calculation outperforms
most other logP calculation methods. Tetko et al, Calculation of molecular
lipophilicity: State-of-the-art and comparison of log P methods on more than
96,000 compounds J. Pharm. Sci. 2009, 98 (3), 861-93.</p>

<p><h3><a name="clogs"></a>cLogS Calculation</h3></p>
<table>
<tr>
<td><img SRC="logSDis.png"></td>
<td>The aquous solubility of a compound significantly affects its absorption
and distribution characteristics. Typically, a low solubility goes along
with a bad absorption and therefore the general aim is to avoid poorly
soluble compounds. Our estimated logS similarity is a unit stripped logarithm
(base 10) of the solubility measured in mol/liter.
<p>In the left diagram you can see that more than 80% of the drugs on the
market have a (estimated) logS similarity greater than -4.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<br>
<table>
<tr>
<td>Similar to our in-house logP calculation we assess the solubility via
an increment system by adding atom contributions depending on their atom
types. The atom types employed here differ slightly from the ones used
for the cLogP estimation in that respect that the ring membership is not
looked at. Still there are 271 distinguishable atom types describing the
atom and its near surrounding. More than 2000 compounds with experimentally
determined solubility values (25 degrees, pH=7.5) were used as training
set to optimize the contribution values associated with the atom types.
The correlation plot on the right shows calculated versus experimentally
determined logS. You can see that the precision of the logS estimation
is worse than the one for logP. This is because the solubility of a substance
depends to a certain extend on how effectively the molecules are arranged
in the crystall and these topological aspects cannot be predicted via atom
types nor substructure fragments.</td>

<td>The polar surface area (PSA) is defined as the surface sum over all polar atoms,
(oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur and phosphorus), including also attached hydrogens.
PSA is a commonly used medicinal chemistry metric for the optimisation of cell
permeability. Molecules with a polar surface area of greater than 140 square
angstrom are usually believed to be poor at permeating cell membranes. For
molecules to penetrate the blood-brain barrier (and thus acting on receptors
in the central nervous system), PSA should be less than 60 square angstrom.</td>

<p><h3><a name="tox"></a>Toxicity Risk Assessment</h3></p>
<p>The toxicity risk assessment tries to locate substructures within the
chemical structure being indicative of a toxicity risk within one of four
major toxicity classes. Risk alerts are by no means meant to be a fully
reliable toxicity prediction. Nor should be concluded from the absence of
risk alerts that a particular substance would be completely free of any
toxic effect.</p>
<p>In order to assess the toxicity prediction's reliability we ran a set
of toxic compounds and a set of presumably non-toxic compounds through
the prediction. The diagram below shows the results obtained by predicting
all available structures of four subsets of the RTECS database. E.g. all
structures known to be mutagenic were run through the mutagenicity assessment.
86 % of these structures where found to bear a high or medium risk of being
mutagenic. As a controlset served a collection of traded drugs of which
the mutagenicity risk assessment revealed only 12 % of potentially harmful
compounds.</p>
<p><center><img SRC="toxstat.png"></center></p>
<p>The prediction process relies on a precomputed set of structural fragment
that give rise to toxicity alerts in case they are encountered in the structure
currently drawn. These fragment lists were created by rigorously shreddering
all compounds of the RTECS database known to be active in a certain toxicity
class (e.g. mutagenicity). During the shreddering any molecule was first
cut at every rotatable bonds leading to a set of core fragments. These
in turn were used to reconstruct all possible bigger fragments being a
substructure of the original molecule. Afterwards, a substructure search
process determined the occurence frequency of any fragment (core and constructed
fragments) within all compounds of that toxicity class. It also determined
these fragment's frequencies within the structures of more than 3000 traded
drugs. Based on the assumption that traded drugs are largely free of toxic
effects, any fragment was considered a risk factor if it occured often
as substructure of harmful compounds but never or rarely in traded drugs.</p>

<br>

<p><h3><a name="druglikeness"></a>Fragment Based Druglikeness</h3></p>
<p>There are many approaches around that assess a compound's <i>druglikeness</i>
partially based on topological descriptors, fingerprints of MDL struture
keys or other properties as cLogP and molecular weights. Our approach is
based on a list of about 5300 distinct substructure fragments with associated
druglikeness scores. The druglikeness is calculated with the following
equation summing up score values of those fragments that are present in
the molecule under investigation:</p>
<p><center><img src="dlFormula.png"></center></p>
<p>The fragmentlist was created by shreddering 3300 traded drugs as well
as 15000 commercially available chemicals (Fluka) yielding a complete list
of all available fragments. As a restriction the shredder considered only
rotatable bonds as cuttable. In addition the substitution modes of all
fragment atoms were retained, i.e. fragment atoms that hadn't been further
subtituted in the original compounds were marked as such and atoms being
part of a bond that was cut were marked as carrying a further substituent.
This way fragment substitution patterns are included in the fragments.</p>
<p>The occurence frequency of every one of the fragments was determined
within the collection of traded drugs and within the supposedly non-drug-like
collection of Fluka compounds. All fragments with an overall frequency
above a certain threshold were inverse clustered in order to remove highly
redundant fragments. For the remaining fragments the druglikeness score
was determined as the logarithm of the quotent of frequencies in traded
drugs versus Fluka chemicals.</p>
<table>
<tr>
<td><img src="DLDis.png"></td>
<td>The diagrams shows the distribution of druglikeness values calculated
from 15000 Fluka compounds and from 3300 traded drugs. It shows that about
80% of the drugs have a positive druglikeness similarity whereas the big majority
of Fluka chemicals accounts for the negative values.
<p>Thus, try to keep your compounds in the positive range...</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>A positive similarity states that your molecule contains predominatly fragments
which are frequently present in commercial drugs. What it doesn't necessarily
mean, though, is that these fragments are well ballanced concerning other
properties. For instance, a molecule may be composed of drug-like, but
lipophilic fragments only. This molecule will have a high druglikeness
score although it wouldn't really qualify for being a drug because of its
high lipophilicity.</p>

<br>

<p><h3><a name="drugscore"></a>Drug Score</h3></p>
<p>The drug score combines druglikeness, cLogP, logS, molecular weight and
toxicity risks in one handy similarity that may be used to judge the compound's
overall potential to qualify for a drug. This similarity is calculated by multiplying
contributions of each of the individual properties by the first of these
equations: </p>
<p><center><img src="dsFormula.png"></center></p>
<p>ds is the drug score. s<sub>i</sub> are contribution values calculated 
directly from cLogP, logS, molweight and druglikeness (p<sub>i</sub>) by
the second equation. This equation describes a spline curve with contributions
ranging from 0 to 1 depending on the respective property similarity. Inversion
point and slope of the curve are determined by parameters <i>a</i> and <i>
b, </i>which are (1, -5), (-1, -5), (0.012, -6) and (-1, 0) for cLogP, logS,
molweight and druglikeness, respectively. t<sub>i</sub> are the four contributions 
reflecting the four types of toxicity risks. The t<sub>i</sub> values used
are 1.0, 0.8 and 0.6 for <i>no risk</i>, <i>medium risk</i> and <i>high risk</i>
, respectively.</p>

<br>

<p><h3><a name="flexibility"></a>Molecular Flexibility</h3></p>
<p>The molecular flexibility of a ligand has a substancial influence on the affinity
and specificity when binding to a protein. (e.g. <i>The fundamental role of flexibility on
the strength of molecular binding.</i>C Forrey, J F Douglasb, M K Gilson; Soft Matter, 2012,
<b>8</b>, 6385-6392, DOI: 10.1039/C2SM25160D). DataWarrior can help studing these effects or
aid in planning compound generations with a changed flexibility profile. For this DataWarrior
may calculate the flexibility of a molecule using dihedral angle data from the Crystallography
Open Database (COD). Molecular flexibility values range from 0.0 (rigid) to 1.0 (completely flexible).</p>

<p>Often the number of rotatable bonds is used as a surrogate for molecular flexibility. Unfortunately,
this is a rather sub-optimal approach for two reasons: First, bond rotatability is not a binary property.
While double bonds, amide bonds, and aromatic ring bonds are pretty rigid, 'rotatable' single bonds
range from highly rotatable to rather rigid depending on their rotation energy barriers. Second,
the topological position of a rotatable bonds has a strong influence on the flexibility of a molecule.
DataWarrior's molecular flexibility value tries to circumvent these shortcomings.</p>

<p>These four steps are performed in the calculation:</p>

<p>The conformational flexibility of a molecule and with it the diversity of shapes the molecules can assume
is mainly caused by dihedral angle changes of the molecule's bonds. Therefore, DataWarrior determines in a first
step all rotatable bonds. These are single bonds, which are neither part of an aromatic nor of a 3-, 4- or 5-membered ring.
Moreover, their both atoms must be sp2 or sp3 hybridized and they must carry at least one more non-hydrogen neighbor.
For chains of conjugated triple bonds the following applies: If at least one terminal sp2/sp3 atom has no external neighbor,
then no single bond is considered rotatable. Otherwise that terminal single bond connecting the smaller substituent is
considered the only rotatable bond
of the linear atom strand.</p>

<p>Dihedral angle changes of a bond in the center of a molecule have a much larger effect on the
overall molecule shape than the torsion change of an outer substituent bond. Therefore, an influence
factor is calculated for every rotatable bond that reflects the topological location. It also considers
the limited degree of freedom in case of a ring bond:
<il>
<li>For ring bonds: factor=0.33, since ring bonds cannot be changed without typically affecting two other rings bonds</li>
<li>Other bonds: factor=sqrt(2.0 * smallerSideNonHydrogenAtomCount / moleculeNonHydrogenAtomCount)</li>
</il>
</p>

<p>The flexibility of every individual rotatable bond is then determined from statistical torsion data of similar
bonds taken from the COD. For instance the C-O bond in a C-O-C-C strain is considered
much more flexible than the central bond in a C-C-C-C chain, which has a strong preference towards the anti-conformation.
For every rotatable bond a characterizing substructure is generated from its local environment.
This substructure consists of the two bond atoms, their direct neighbour atoms and the next shell of neighbour atoms.
It includes all connecting bond orders and various properties, e.g. whether atoms are in a ring, are aromatic,
the stereo configuration, etc. Then a canonical representation of the bond's characterizing substructure is built.
The same mechanism was used earlier to characterize all rotatable bonds of all organic structures of the COD.
Now using a bond's canonical key, DataWarrior can look up a torsion angle distribution curve of all equal substructures
within the COD. The number of peaks, their heights and their widths are now used to
generate the bond specific flexibility value. Angle frequency distributions with multiple wide maxima
of similar heights cause flexibility values close to 1.0 while histograms with one narrow single
peak are close to 0.0.</p>

<p>Finally, from the number of all molecule bonds, the number of rotatabale bonds, their specific flexibility values,
and their geometry weighting factor an overall molecular flexibility value is calculated.</p>

<br>

<p><h3><a name="globularity"></a>Molecular Shape and Globularity</h3></p>
<p>The globularity of a compound is a value that describes how well the molecule's three dimensional shape
resembles a sphere, but there are multiple ways to calculate globularity values and globularity values taken
from different tools using different methods don't necessarily correlate well.
Nevertheless, globularity values play an important part in property in molecular property prediction.
For instance, low molecular globularity seems to be a precondition for compounds to traverse the outer
membrane of Gram-negative bacteria.
(doi:10.1038/nature22308; M F Richter, B S Drown, A P Riley, A Garcia, T Shirai, R L Svec, P J Hergenrother;
<i>Predictive compound accumulation rules yield a broad-spectrum antibiotic</i>; <b>545</b> (2017), 299).</p>

<p>DataWarrior uses three different methods to produce a value that somehow describes the molecular shape
of a molecule:</p>

<p><b>Molecular Shape Index:</b> This method works on the 2-dimensional non-hydrogen atom and bond graph of the molecule.
It determines those two atoms with the highest topological distance. These are those two atom, whose shortest
connecting chain is longer (or equal) than that of any other atom pair in the molecule. The the number of atoms
in that chain id divided by the number of atoms in the molecule. Thus, values of 1.0 represent perfect chains
and the smaller the value the more rings and bridges are in the molecule.</p>

<p><b>Globularity SVD:</b> This method works on the 3-dimensional atom coordinates of multiple conformers of
the given molecule. If the selected structure column has attached 3-dimensional atom coordinates,
then these are used to calculate the value. If multiple columns exist, then the first is used.
If 3D-coordinates cannot be found, DataWarrior generates up to 16 non-minimized conformers on the fly
using random combinations of low-energy torsion angles.<br>
For every conformer it starts with a singular value decomposition of all atoms in three
dimensions. From that it takes those three orthogonal axes in space, which have the largest, the second largest,
and the smallest variance of atom positions. Then the smallest rectangular box is determines that fits the
conformer and whose edges are parallel to the three axes. The globularity value is then calculated as ratio
from the smallest and the largest edge size of the box. This way values range from close to 1.0 for spherical
molecules to 0.0 for perfectly flat or linear molecules. The final globularity value is an average of those
calculated from the individual conformers.</p>

<p><b>Globularity Vol:</b> This method also works on the 3-dimensional atom coordinates of multiple conformers.
As with the previous method, these are generated on the fly if the dataset doesn't contain them.
For every conformer DataWarrior generates a solvent excluded surface (Conolly surface) with Van-der-Waals radii
using a probe of 1.4 Angstroms. From the surface it calculates its exact area A1 and the enclosed volume.
Then the surface area A2 of a perfect sphere is calculated, which would match the molecule's volume exactly.
The globularity value is then calculated as ratio from A2 and A1.
Real life values calculated by this method range from close to 1.0 for spherical molecules to about 0.6 for
linear molecules with irregular shapes. The final globularity value is an average of those calculated from the
individual conformers.</p>

<p>Note that these three methods differ substancially in their results. The following three conformers of
the same molecule illustrate why: The SVD based method considers the molecule being globular, while the surface based
method assigns a rather low globularity. The conformer picture reveals the reason: While the molecule's sizes
in all three dimensions are very similar, the molecular surface is much higher than that of a sphere with
the same volume.</p>

<p><h2>Normalized Activity Measures</h2></p>
<p><h3><a name="le"></a>Ligand Efficiency <i>LE</i></h3></p>
<p>The ligand efficiency is a measure for the activity normalized by the number of non-H atoms.
More precisely, it is the relative free binding energy in <b>kcal/mol per non-H atom</b>,
calculated from an IC<sub>50</sub> similarity. Especially in early project stages prioritizing compounds
based on their ligand efficiency values is a much more favorable approach compared to judging from
plain activities alone:
<i>"For the purposes of HTS follow-up, we recommend considering optimizing the hits or leads with
the highest ligand efficiencies rather than the most potent..."</i> (Ref.: A. L. Hopkins et al., <i>Drug
Disc. Today</i>, <b>9</b> (2004), pp. 430-431).</p>
<p>To give an example: A compound with 30 atoms (400 MW) that binds with a <i>K</i><sub>d</sub>=10 nM
has a ligand efficiency similarity of 0.36 kcal/mol per non-H atom. Another compound with 38 non-H atoms (500 MW)
and the same ligand efficiency would have a 100 fold higher activity with <i>K</i><sub>d</sub>=0.106 nM.
Let us assume an HTS screening revealed two hit compounds A and B with equal activities of IC<sub>50</sub>=10
nm, but different molecular weights of 400 and 500, respectively. Based on activities both compounds look
equally attractive. Considering, however, that a synthetic introduction of a new group with 8 non-H
atoms into compound A would match compound B in terms of weight, but would increase the activity by a factor
of 100, if its ligand efficiency similarity can be maintained, it becomes clear that compound A is the by far
more attractive alternative.</p>

<br>

<p><h3><a name="lle"></a>Lipophilic ligand Efficiency <i>LLE</i></h3></p>
<p>The LLE similarity is a builds on the fact that the typical compounds of drug discovery projects huddle at
the lipophilic side of the acceptable lipophilicity range. A gain in lipophilicity therefore is associated
with a loss in bioavailability and should be compensated by higher activity on the target. To express this
relationship the LLE is calculated as LLE = -log IC<sub>50</sub> - cLogP. A rough rule of thumb may be the
suggestion of Jonathan S. Mason from Lundbeck Research to aim for LLE values above 3
for lead compounds and above 5 for clinical candidates.</p>

<br>

<p><h3><a name="lelp"></a>Ligand Efficiency lipophilic price <i>LELP</i></h3></p>
<p>Since the ligand efficiency doesn't take lipophilicity into account while the LLE neglects the
molecular weight influence, Keseru and Makara suggest using the LELP similarity instead:
"... So, we propose simply to use <b>LELP = logP / ligand efficiency</b> as a useful function to depict
the price of ligand efficiency paid in logP. Medicinal chemists who are familiar with both logP
and ligand efficiency can easily relate to the change in logP per ligand efficiency unit. As such,
LELP is negative only when logP is negative, and the higher the absolute similarity of LELP the less
drug-like the lead compound. The widely accepted lower limit of ligand efficiency has been 0.3,
and the lipophilicity range for lead-like compounds is -3 < logP < 3. These values define the
range -10 < LELP < 10 for acceptable leads, and LELP would have to be less than 16.5 for compounds
that are in the Lipinski zone. For typical lead discovery projects, the closer LELP is to zero in the
positive range, the better. In our experience a truly good hit or lead in the early optimization stage
has a ligand efficiency > 0.40-0.45 and 0 < logP < 3. So, the desirable range for LELP is between 0 and 7.5.
LELP becomes a useful function to follow during hit-to-lead optimizations, as for typical lead discovery
projects LELP should be moving towards zero with improving potency." (Ref.: G. M. Keseru & G. M. Makara,
