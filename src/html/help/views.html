<h2><b><a name="MainViews"></a>DataWarrior Main Views</b></h2>

<hr align="left" size="2" width="600">
<p>The <span class="keyword">Main Views</span> of <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> are the windows
to your data. They display all rows or the visible subset of all rows in a view specific way.
When you open data from a text file, paste data from the clipboard or retrieve data from a database,
then <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> automatically creates a few default views.
You may, however, at any time close existing views or create new views from the popup menu
that appears after a right mouse button click on any main view's header area.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="help/img/views/viewPopup.jpeg"></p>

<p>While default views are created side-by-side, views may also be stacked on top of each other.
<span class="keyword">Main Views</span> can be arranged freely by dragging one view's header area
to another view and dropping it either on the target view's center or close to one of its four edges.
A semitransparent ghost view indicates what will happens, when the view is dropped at the current position.
When dropped at the center, the dragged view would be stacked on top of the target view. Otherwise,
it would horizontally or vertically split the space of the target view and occupy half of it for itself.
Views can be resized by dragging the divider area between the views.
At any time any visible view can be maximized in size to cover the entire main view area by clicking the
<span class="menu">maximize</span> button on the view's header area.</p>

<br>
<h3><a name="TableView"></a>The Table View</h3>
<p>The <span class="keyword">Table View</span> is the only mandatory view, which means that
it is automatically created when you open data from any source and it cannot be closed.
It offers a spreadsheet like view on all <span class="keyword">visible rows</span>,
i.e. those data rows that are not hidden by any filter. It also shows visible columns only.
Columns may be inherently invisible or they may be temporarily defined to be invisible.</p>

<p>Any column that is shown in the <span class="keyword">Table View</span> displays data
of the respective column of the underlying data table. Typically, all cells of a column contain
data of the same kind, e.g. numerical data, dates, categories, chemical structures, identifiers, or text.
<span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> automatically analyzes all column content to figure out, whether
the column contains integer values, floating point values, text, chemical structures, or reactions.
It also determines, whether multiple cells contain the same information and then concludes that the column
contains categorical information, even if the content is numerical or consists of chemical structures.
If some columns contain superflous spaces or non-numerical symbols, then <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span>
may not correctly recognize a column. In such cases one may override the automatic detection by selecting
<span class="menu">Set Column Data Type To ...</span> from the popup menu that appears on a right mouse click
on the respective column header. In very large files, <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> may also
not indicate categorical data as such to save some memory. The menu item <span class="menu">Force Categories</span>
from the same popup menu forces <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> to treat the column as categorical data.</p>

<p>Some columns of the underlying data table may not be displayable, e.g. chemical descriptors or
3D-atom coordinates. Under the hood, these columns are associated with one displayable parent
column and hold supporting information for various purposes. For instance, chemical descriptors,
which relate to a chemical structure column, are used to calculate structure similarities
or they are used internally to accelerate the sub-structure filtering. Invisible atom coordinates
or atom color information are used to display 2D-structure pictures or rotatable 3D-conformers.</p>

<p><b>Cell coloring:</b> Typically, text and chemical structures are drawn in black or white, depending on the chosen look and feel.
However, for any column the foreground drawing color as well as the cell's background colors can be chosen
to reflect the data values of this or other columns' cell values. Colors may also represent
the similarity of this row's molecule compared to the molecule in the <span class="keyword">Reference Row</span>.
In this case colors change dynamically, whenever the <span class="keyword">Reference Row</span> is changed.
Column color assignments can be done with <span class="menu">Set Text/Structure/Background Color...</span> from
the popup menu that opens upon a right click on the respective column title.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="help/img/views/tableView.png" width="680" height="370"></p>
<p align="center"><i>Table View with buttons; 1: Scroll to Reference Row, 2: Expand Column Titles, 3: Column Filter</i></p>

<p>Column content is automatically analysed whether it is numerical data, date values,
categories, or just unstructed text.
For numerical and date columns the covered data range is determined and for category data a list
of found categories is maintained. What <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> can do with a column
depends on the kind of data it contains. When you hover with the mouse over a column title,
then a tooltip with the column's characteristics is shown.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="help/img/views/tabletooltip.png" width="342" height="158"></p>
<p align="center"><i>Tooltip over column title showing column characteristics</i></p>

<p>Table cells may contain multiple values of the same kind, e.g. multiple numerical values.
If a cell contains multiple values, then these are either separated by "; " (semicolon and space)
or they are in separated lines within the same cell.
If a column contains category values and if one of its cells contains multiple distinct values,
then this row belongs to multiple categories in regard to this column.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> There are two popup menus to access table view related functionality.
The popup menu that opens on the table view's header (i.e. title bar) give you acces to
general view and table view related functionality as font size and column order. The second
popup menu available from any column title mainly related to functionality concerning that
respective column. However, there is a gray zone.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="help/img/views/tablemenus.png" width="400" height="340"></p>
<p align="center"><i>Popup menus available from table view header and column title</i></p>

<p><b>Display mode:</b> Numerical columns may be defined to show rounded values by selecting the
<span class="menu">Show Rounded Values...</span> option from the column header's popup menu.
For columns containing multiple values in at least one cell,
the <span class="menu">Show Multiple Values As...</span> option from the same popup menu
allows to select a summary mode. Multiple values will then be summarized into one value being shown in the cell.
Typically, average or median values are shown, but available options also include the largest, the smallest, or
the sum of all cell values. If a summary mode is defined for a column, then it is not only shown in
the <span class="keyword">Table View</span>, but it is used whenever DataWarrior accesses numerical values
of this column, e.g. in filters, 2D- or 3D-views, in calculations, and even when cells are copied to the clipboard.
If, for instance, a filter is set to hide objects smaller than 100 cm, and if an object's size column
contains "80; 110", and if this column's summary mode is set to <span class="menu">Show Highest Value</span>,
then this object is not hidden by the filter.
If <span class="menu">All Values</span> are shown, then DataWarrior automatically uses
a mean value in graphical views and filters. If the column is set to <span class="keyword">logarithmic mode</span>
then geometric mean values are used.</p>

<p><b>Selecting cells</b> in the <span class="keyword">Table View</span> works in a 2-dimensional way,
which means that by selecting cells you modify the selection of columns and rows. The latter
affects all views, because the row selection is shared among all views.
The column selection, however, is affecting the <span class="keyword">Table View</span> only.
Nevertheless, the are some issues that need to be understood:
First, if no columns are selected and you select some rows outside of the <span class="keyword">Table View</span>,
then you don't see any selection in the <span class="keyword">Table View</span>, because no columns are selected.
Thus, if you intend to select rows in another view in order to later copy cells from the
<span class="keyword">Table View</span>,  then select the needed columns first.
Continuous selection can be achieved by dragging the mouse from one cell to another or by
selecting one cell first and clicking another cell while pressing the <span class="menu">Shift</span> 
key. Doing the same thing with the <span class="menu">Ctrl</span> key (<span class="menu">Cmd</span> key on the Macintosh)
allows to select disconnected cells, columns and rows.</p>

<p>The <span class="keyword">Reference Row</span> is indicated by a red border around it.
In the <span class="keyword">Table View</span> you may change the <span class="keyword">Reference Row</span>
by clicking on the row number on the left hand side. If the <span class="keyword">Reference Row</span>
is not visible because it is scrolled out of the visible range, then the table can be scrolled to reveal
the current <span class="keyword">Reference Row</span> by clicking the top left arrow-button.</p>

<p><b>Sorting:</b> The rows of a <span class="keyword">Table View</span> may be sorted by clicking
on the respective column header. Depending on the column's data content the sorting will
be numerically, alphabetically or by the size of chemical structures. Where cells have the same content,
the previous sort order is retained. The selection of rows and columns is unaffected by sorting.
Other views that display rows in order (<span class="keyword">Structure View</span>
and <span class="keyword">Form View</span>) share the <span class="keyword">Table View</span>'s sort order.
You may use this behaviour to sort the <span class="keyword">Table View</span>
for instance by some ascending biological activity and then switch to the
<span class="keyword">Structure View</span>, where the most active structures 
now start at the top. If some rows are selected and the <span class="menu">Shift</span>
key is pressed during sorting, then all selected rows are moved to the top of the
table; selected and unselected rows are still sorted independently.</p>

<p><b>Column order:</b> The order of visible columns in a table can easily be changed by dragging one
column title horizontally to a new position. For files with hundreds of columns, however, a complete
re-organization of the column order this way would be a very tiresome task. This can be done
more efficiently using a dedicated dialog that opens when selecting <span class="menu">Change
Column Order...</span> from the view header popup menu. The dialog allows to drag single or multiple
column titles at once to a new position.</p>

<p><b>Column grouping:</b> Another set of features, which is particularly useful for files with many
columns is the ability to associate a subset of all column in a group. A column may be member of multiple
groups. If groups are defined every group has an associated color, which is used to decorate its
members' column titles. A column that is member of multiple groups, has a decoration in gray.</p>

<p><b>Column visibility:</b> Another set of features, which is particularly useful for files with many
columns is column hiding. The column title popup menu allows to reversibly hide individual or selected
columns from the view. When column groups are defined then one can show only those columns that
belong to a particular group.</p>

<p><b>Column filtering:</b> Clicking the spy glass button at the top left of the table view opens
a text field that can be used to define filter criteria, which immediately hide not matching columns.
When the field contains a text string, then only columns are shown, whose title contains the query string.
Multiple query strings can be given by separating them with commas (','). If the text string starts
with 'regex:', then everything that follows is interpreted as a <a class="links" href="help/regex.html">
regular expression</a> for full search flexibility.</p>

<p><b>Editing:</b> The <span class="keyword">Table View</span> also permits editing the data. After
double clicking into a cell a data type specific editor lets you edit the cell's content.
After choosing <span class="menu">OK</span> the entire column is re-evaluated, because its
perceived data type may have been changed after the edit. Filters and views may be updated
to reflect the change and to avoid conflicts that might arise from a changed data type.</p>

<p><b>Detail data:</b> In DataWarrior a table cell may have associated detail information like pictures
or formatted text. Such detail information is not shown in the <span class="keyword">Table View</span>.
Detail information is shown in the <span class="keyword">Detail View</span> in the lower right
part of every <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> window. And it may be shown in form views.
In the <span class="keyword">Table View</span> cells with detail content display a number
on a small colored rectangle in the right upper corner indicating how many detail objects are available.
The detail content itself may be either part of the <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> file
or the file may only contain references to the details along with the information of how to access it.
Green or brown backgrounds indicate file internal detail or referenced details, respectively.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="help/img/views/detailMarkers.jpeg"></p>
<p align="center"><i>Table with green detail markers indicating file-embedded detail text and pictures.</i></p>

<p><b>Links:</b> Columns may also contain clickable web links. These may be valid complete URLs,
or they may just contain keys or names of some kind and the column meta data tells
<span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span>
how to construct a full URL from it. Examples are the tables generated by a <span class="keyword">
Wikipedia</span> retrieval or a <span class="keyword">Google Patents</span> search.</p>

<br>

<h3><a name="2DAnd3D"></a>Graphical 2D- and 3D-Views</h3>

<p>The graphical 2D- and 3D-Views incorporate plenty of functionality. Most important
are the two or three axes that define the numerical/category space in which the data
is shown. The <span class="menu">xyz</span> button on the the view's header area opens
a popup menu for defining, which axis is used in which way. Here you may assign a data
column to any of the axes by selecting it within the respective axis popup menu.
Columns that don't contain numerical values, date values, category information or chemical descriptors
cannot be assigned to axes and, therefore, don't appear in the column menus.
Columns with incomplete data, i.e. with some empty cells, appear in red color indicating
that some rows of the data may not be shown, if this column is selected. Non-numerical 
category columns appear in blue color, while complete numerical or date columns
are shown in black.<br>
You may use the double ended range sliders to zoom into the numerical or category space of any axis.
This is done by dragging the slider's left or right thumb area towards the middle. Pressing the Ctrl-key
while dragging the thumb increases the resolution by a factor of 20. You may also double click
the thumb area to type-in an exact value. Finally, using the scroll wheel of a mouse or
or a scroll gesture on a touch pad will also zoom into or out of the view. After zooming into a 2D-view,
you may move the visible area by dragging the middle of the range slider. Alternatively, you may
drag the view  itself with the mouse while pressing the Ctrl-key.
</p>

<p align="center"><img src="help/img/views/axesColumnMenu.jpeg"></p>

<p>Graphical views can be linked to another view, such that their axes-column assignments and
their zoom and rotation states are kept synchronized to those of the linked view.
When you change the axis-assigment of a synchronized view or when you zoom into it or rotate it,
then all synchronized views behave immedately the same. This way you may use some 3D-views side by side,
whose markers encode different properties, but show the same objects and rotate and zoom synchronously.
A view can be synchronized to another view by selecting <span class="menu">Synchronize View To</span>
from the popup menu in the view's header area. The controlling view, which propagates its settings
to one or more linked views, mare have more but not less dimensions than any client view.
This means, a 2D-view may be attached to and controlled by a 3D-view, but not the other way round.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="help/img/views/synchronizedViews.jpeg"></p>
<p align="center"><i>Synchronized views show different properties with same perspective</i></p>

<p>It is a DataWarrior principle that all visible views, usually, display the same rows of data.
2D- and 3D-views, however, have thenselfes an influence on the overall visibility of rows.
For instance, markers that are zoomed out of the view, are not visible anymore.
Rows are also hidden, if a column with incomplete data is assigned to an axis and if the view is configured
to not show empty values.
In such a case these rows are usually hidden in other views as well. If the ristricting
view itself gets invisible, e.g. because is is send to the background and because another view
is displayed on top of it, then the formerly hidden rows reappear again in all remaining visible views.
There are situations, however, where zooming into the data should not affect the row visibility
of other views. Therefore, graphical views can be configured to not
<span class="menu">Hide invisible rows in other views</span> in the view's
<span class="menu">Set General View Options...</span> dialog.</p>

<p> All view specific settings are accessible via a popup menu, which opens with 
a right mouse click anywhere in the view (2D-view) or over any marker (3D-view).</p>

<p align="center"><img src="help/img/views/2dViewPopup.jpeg"></p>

<p>Since the graphical views support multiple fundamentally different chart/view types,
often the first thing to do after creating a new view is defining, which view type to show.
This is done by choosing <span class="menu">Set Preferred Chart Type...</span>
and configuring the options in the upcoming dialog. If the columns, which are assigned
to the axes, contain data that is incompatible with the preferred chart type, then
<span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> shows a scatterplot instead, because scatterplots
are compatible with any data type. Bar and pie charts require one or more category columns
while box and whisker plots need one numerical and one category column.
Being presented with an unintended scatterplot, one may still change the axis assignment
to make the preferred chart possible.</p>

<p>Markers and their corresponding data rows can be selected by dragging the mouse
pointer around markers. If you press the <span class="menu">Alt</span> 
key before starting the selection, you automatically select a rectangular area.
Pressing the <span class="menu">Shift</span> key causes any new selection to be added to a
previous selection. The effects of the <span class="menu">Alt</span> and <span class="menu">Shift</span>
keys can be combined.</p>

<p>The 3D-View can be rotated by pressing and immediately dragging the mouse with the
<b>right mouse button</b>. If the <b>Shift</b> key is kept pressed while the view is
rotated, then the rotation is restricted to a pure horizontal or vertical rotation.
Note that in 3D-views the right mouse button is used to rotate views as well as to
show a popup menu to configure view details. If you press and drag, then the view rotates.
If you press and release or wait for 800 ms then the popup appears.</p>

<p>To visualize more dimensions than already given by the 2D- or 3D-coordinate systems,
marker colors, sizes or shapes can be associated to data columns to reflect numerical
or categorical cell values. Naturally, marker shapes can not represent numerical data and
can only represent category information, if the number of categories does not exceed the
number of available shapes.</p>

<p> Moreover, the 2D-view allows to tinge the background according to closeby markers'
column values. In this case every marker emits a corona of color that fades
with increasing distance. All overlapping colors mix in hue and saturation to create 
a smooth colorful property landscape, where areas with similar colors visualize areas 
of similar properties. Consequently, background coloring is particularly useful 
if the property associated to it correlates to some extend with the column values that
are assigned to the x- and y-axis. In other words background colors are used best,
if close markers have similar properties, e.g. in a chemical space visualization.
The background color dialog is accessible from the <span class="menu">Set Marker
Background Color...</span> item from the view popup menu.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="help/img/views/bgColorDialog.jpeg"></p>

<p>Both, the radius of the affected area around markers and the color fading with distance
can be defined in the dialog. One needs to play around a little to find optimal settings.
As default all visible rows contribute to background coloring. If row lists are defined
one may alternatively select a row list. The color landscape than visualizes the properties
of the list members only, even if the markers of these list members are not visible in the view.
This way a view's background may visualize some property space, while an independent set
of visible rows is shown on top of it.</p>

<p><span class="menu">Set Marker Labels...</span> offers decorating markers with resizeable
labels at up to eight positions around the marker. A label may even be shown instead of the
marker. Labels show the content of an associated column, which may be alphanumerical or a
chemical structure. Labels may be shown for all markers or only for a subset of markers.
In the latter case one needs to define a row list containing the rows to be decorated with
labels. This list then needs to be selected from the <span class="menu">Show labels on</span> choices.
An alternative way of restricting labels to a subset of all rows would be setting the view's
<span class="keyword">focus</span> on a data subset (see below).</p>

<p align="center"><img src="help/img/views/labels.jpeg"></p>

<p>The view above shows airplane names for some of the markers. Notice, that the labels were
manually moved to less populated locations to avoid label collisions with data and other labels.
In <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> labels may simply be dragged from their default locations
to other locations using the mouse.</p>

<p>The <span class="menu">Set Focus To Row List...</span> option puts a visual focus on a 
certain group of markers. The markers in focus are drawn on top of the remaining markers,
while the remaining ones are drawn in a dimmed way. If marker labels are set to be shown, then
only those row markers are decorated with labels, which are in the focus. This lets 
you show a certain group of rows in the context of a bigger group. The rows in the focus
are either those rows that belong to a row list or all selected rows are considered to be in the focus.
In the latter case the focus is changing, whenever the selection changes.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="help/img/views/focus.jpeg"></p>

<p>The above chart shows GDP and life expectancy of the states of the world in 1950.
The focus is set to highlight the current G8 states.</p>

<p><span class="menu">Set Marker Jittering...</span> adds an adjustable random displacement 
to the positions of any marker. This can be useful if you have groups of markers 
that overlap at exactly the same positions and therefore appear as single markers. 
Typically, this is happens frequently with category data. Adding some jittering 
lets you visually perceive the number of markers within every category. Displaying the data
with a bar or pie chart may often be an alternatively.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="help/img/views/jitteredSOM.jpeg"></p>

<p align="left">In the example above all compounds of a drug discovery project were 
clustered by a self-organizing map, such that every molecule was assigned to one of
18 by 18 nodes. The above view shows the nodes in a 2-dimensional grid.
Some jittering was added to scatter all members of every cluster around the respective grid
position. The view background and the markers are colored according to the biological 
activity and compound synthesis date, respectively. Note that background coloring works
well in this example, because the compound on every node are very similar and, therefore,
usually have similar activities causing a consisten background color around the node.</p>

<p>The menu item <span class="menu">Split View By Categories...</span> lets you split
one 2D view into multiple equally scaled 2D-views of which each contains only those
rows that belong to a certain category. Therefore, defining view splitting means
selecting one or even two category columns as basis for the splitting.
If you select one column, then the
individual views are automatically arranged in a grid such that the grid cell widths
and heights are similar. If two category columns are defined then the grid will have
an n*m topology with n and m reflecting the number of categories in each column.
For an example see the image below.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="help/img/views/splitViews.jpeg"></p>
<br>

<h3><a name="ConnectionLines"></a>Connection Lines</h3>

Whenever the change of a numerical parameter over time shall be visualized, or when
some logical connection between objects needs to be shown, or whenever a tree graph
needs to be displayed, then drawing lines between markers is a crucial functionality.
In <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> connection lines can be defined in the dialog
accessible through <span class="menu">Set Connection Lines...</span>.

<p align="center"><img width=357 height=306 src="help/img/views/connectionLineDialog.jpeg"></p>

<p><b>Group & connect by:</b> This setting defines whether to show connection lines and whether
in this case a category column is used to group markers. If a category column is chosen, then
all markers belonging to one category are independently connected by lines.
Select the option <span class="menu">&lt;Don't group, connect all&gt;</span> if you want all markers
to be connected with one line.<br>
Some datasets, e.g. after an <span class="keyword">Activity Cliff Analysis</span>
contain columns, with define links beween rows. Such row connecting columns also show up
in this menu and cause, if selected, those links to be shown as connecting lines.</p>

<p><b>Connection order by:</b> This option defines in which order individual markers of
the selected groups are connected. Typically, marker are simply connected from left to right,
i.e. along the x-axis. Alternatively, any numerical column can be selected here to define
the order.</p>

<p><b>Relative line width:</b> This defines the width of the connection lines.</p>

<p><b>Invert arrow direction:</b> If markers are connected by a column, which references key values
of another column in a directional way, e.g. after creating an <span class="keyword">Evolutionary Library</span>,
then connection lines are automatically drawn with arrows indicating the direction to the parent marker.
This option allows to invert the arrow direction..</p>

<p align="center"><img src="help/img/views/connectionLines.jpeg"></p>

<p>In the example above the <i>Country</i> column was selected for grouping and connecting markers.
<span class="menu">&lt;X-axis&gt;</span> was selected as the connection order. The marker size
was reduced to zero to effectively hide any markers.</p>

<p><b>Detail tree mode:</b> This mode can only be selected, if in <b>Group & connect by:</b>
a column is selected that contains references to other rows. If a detail tree mode is chosen,
and if a <span class="keyword">Reference Row</span> is selected, then the view does not show
markers being positioned by values of columns assigned to axes. Instead, it takes the
<span class="keyword">Reference Row</span> as root node of a detail graph. Then it adds all
directly connected rows as second layer of the graph. All not yet used rows connected to any
second layer row are added as third layer and so forth until the defined number of graph levels is reached.
The layout of the detail graph is either radial or a horizontal or vertical tree, depending
on this menu's setting (see following image).</p>

<p align="center"><img src="help/img/views/detailTrees.jpeg"></p>

<p><span class="menu">Show all markers if no tree root is chosen:</span> If a detail tree mode is selected,
one may toggle between seeing all markers and a specific detail tree by clicking either on a marker to make
this the new root or by clicking into the empty space to see all markers again. If a view is meant to show
a detail graph view only and should never show marker assigned to selected axes, then one may
deselect this checkbox.</p>

<p><b>If nodes get invisible, re-arrange and remove sub-branches:</b> Like all other views, a detail tree
view shows markers only, if they are not hidden by filters or other views. If this option is not selected,
then the graph is constructed once after the root is chosen and using all its visible and non-visible neighbours.
When rows are hidden, they just disappear with their connection lines from the view. If, however, this option
is selected, then the layout of the graph is freshly created, whenever rows are hidden or un-hidden, taking only
those neighbours into consideration that are currently visible. This way marker positions change with visibility,
but the avaliable space is evenly used.</p>

<p><b>Invert tree line directions:</b> If markers are connected by a column, which references key values
of another column in a directional way, e.g. after creating an <span class="keyword">Evolutionary Library</span>,
then a detail graph layer is compiled by taking all rows referenced by the previous layer's rows.
If this option is chosen, then the next layer is always build from rows referencing the current layer's rows.
This effectively inverts the direction of reference.</p>

<p><b>Detail tree layers:</b> This defines the maximum number of displayed neighbor levels around
or beneath the root row.</p>
<br>

<h3><a name="BarsAndPies"></a>Bar Charts And Pie Charts</h3>

<p align="left">If all axis of a graphical view are either unassigned or connected
to a column with category data, then the view can be configured to show a bar chart
or pie chart. This is done by selecting <span class="menu">Set Preferred Chart Type...</span>
from the view's popup menu and selecting <span class="menu">Bar Chart</span> in
the upcomping dialog.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="help/img/views/chartTypeDialog.jpeg"></p>

<p>Per default bar charts are histograms, which means that any bar's size
represents the number of rows in the respective category. 
Alternatively, the bar's size may reflect numerical values of a specific column.
Since one bar often represents multiple rows, the values of these rows need to be
summarized somehow that one bar's size can reflect them. Therefore, one needs to select
one of the summary modes in the <span class="menu">Bar/Pie size by:</span> menu.
Current options are mean, minimum, maximum or the sum of the individual values.

<p align="center"><img src="help/img/views/barChart.jpeg"></p>

<p>In the example above bar sizes directly represent values of the <i>Amount</i> column.
The chart is defined to show <span class="menu">Mean Values</span>, but since in this case
every bar contains one data row only, the mean values are equal the exact row values.<br>
This example uses <i>Case Separation</i> to split bars by the 'Kind' column to show
'Earnings' and 'Spendings' for every year side by side rather than the mean value of both
values in one bar, which would not make much sense.</p>

<p>If marker colors are associated to a data column with <span class="menu">Set Marker Color...</span>,
then bars are drawn in multiple colors such that the bar visualizes the property distribution
within the category that is represented by the bar. Marker background coloring,
marker shapes and marker sizes cannot be used with bars, because there are no distinct markers anymore.</p>

<p>If a column contains numerical values, e.g. molecular weights of some molecules, and
if a histogram of the distribution of this value shall be shown, then a category column
must be created artificially with a process called <a href="help/data.html#Binning">
<span class="keyword">Binning</span></a>.</p>

<p>Pie charts can be configured analogously to bar charts and can represent the same kind
of information. Since bar bars are typically long and pies are as wide as they are high,
pie charts are often preferred when both axes show categories of similar sizes.
Then the pies just use the space more efficiently. Relative pie sizes can be
adjusted with <span class="menu">Set Marker Size...</span>. This allows oversizing
large pies in order to recognize very small pies as well. Overlapping pies are usually
tolerable and therefore pies can often visualize large size variations better than bars.</p>

<h3><a name="BoxesAndWhiskers"></a>Box Plots, Whisker Plots, and Violin Plots</h3>

<p><span class="keyword">Box Plots, Whisker Plots, or Violin Plots</span> are a great choice,
when the distribution of numerical values shall be visualized. This can be done for the entire dataset,
but more often the intention is to compare the distribution of numerical values in multiple data subsets.
Often, the median, mean, or quartile values are compared between groups, or statistical significance
can be deduced from p-values as a result of a <span class="keyword">t-test</span>.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="help/img/views/boxplot.jpeg"></p>

<p>This example shows a simple box plot with the three main cases split a second time by genders.
The dialog that opens after selecting <span class="menu">Set Statistical View Options...</span>
from the view's popup menu lets one define, which statistical parameters are directly shown in the
view, how fold-change and p-values are calculated, and how mean or median values are indicated in the view.</p>

<p><span class="keyword">Whisker Plots</span> are similar to <span class="keyword">Box Plots</span>.
While the latter depicts a box from the 1st to the 3rd quartile of the data,
the <span class="keyword">Whisker Plot</span> shows all individual values as markers.
If there are many individual values, then it is often difficult to judge where all of them are,
because they highly overlap. In these cases it often helps to add some transparency with
<span class="menu">Set Marker Transparency...</span></p>

<p align="center"><img src="help/img/views/whiskerPlot.jpeg"></p>

<p>In the example above we see a whisker plot with lines connecting the <i>Main Cases</i>,
which are the primary categories shown in a box or whisker plot. Primary cases
are separated by animal species and marker colors also reflect the species.
Since we separate three cases, we also have three lines instead of one. Each line connect
five size groups of one species. Since every species in shown in a different color and
since every line connects markers of one species only, the lines automatically are drawn
in the color associated to the particular species.</p>

<p>Especially, when we have many individual data points, then showing them all in a
<span class="keyword">Whisker Plot</span> as an overlapping cloud of markers may be difficult to
interpret, even if horizontal jittering and transparency is used. A <span class="keyword">Box Plot</span>
on the other hand does not reveal much about the exact distribution of the numerical values.
This is, where <span class="keyword">Violin Plots</span> come into the place. In the center they contain
a thin line in bar direction running from the lowest to the highest value in the group not considering outliers.
A second broader and overlapping line runs from the first to the third quartile. Mean and/or median values
are indicated by red and gray dots, respectively. With these elements a <span class="keyword">Violin Plot</span>
shows the same information as a <span class="keyword">Box Plot</span>. Now comes the clue: In addition
to that a <span class="keyword">Violin Plot</span> consists of two symmetrical density curves. The width
between these outline curves corresponds to the approximate frequency of data points in each region.
This is only approximate, because <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> applies some smoothing, called
<span class="keyword">Kernel Density Estimate (KDE)</span>, that uses a Gaussian function, before drawing the outline.
In <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> one can use <span class="menu">Set Marker Color...</span>
to the visualize the distribution of a second categorical or numerical property within one violin's area
by painting the area using multiple colors. In this case data row counts corresponding to an individual color
are smoothed by the same KDE used previously for all violin members. The width of one color zone approximately
represents the frequency of the respective data subgroup.</p>
<p>The relative width of all violins can be adjusted with <span class="menu">Set Marker Size...</span></p>

<p align="center"><i>Violin Plot with passenger data of the Titanic tragedy.</i></p>

<p>The dataset used for the <span class="keyword">Violin Plot</span> above contains information about
891 passengers of the <span class="keyword">RMS Titanic</span> ocean liner when it sank after hitting
an iceberg in 1912. The plot shows the relation between age, sex, passenger class, and whether they survived.
For 177 passengers some data is missing. These are represented by the markers in the lower NaN area.
All others are split by their survival into two separate plots. Within these plots, passengers are separated
by their booked classes. Finally, the six violins use color to depict the relative counts of male and female
passengers within every age group.</p>

<h3><a name="FormView"></a>The Form View</h3>

<p>With the <span class="keyword">Form View</span>, you can display some or all
fields of one row in a customizable format using the entire main view area.
This view is particularly appropriate if your data contains detail information
that is not visible in the <span class="keyword">Table View</span>. A built-in
form designer lets you custom tailor your forms by defining an underlying grid,
column and row resizing rules, and the locations of form items on the grid.</p>

<p>To create a new <span class="keyword">Form View</span> right-click within
the header area of any existing view and choose
<span class="menu">New Form View</span> from the popup menu. This action creates a
new <span class="keyword">Form View</span> with a default layout containing form items
for every available column or detail information. You can keep it unchanged or
modify the layout using the <span class="keyword">Form Designer</span>.
This layout editor allows to customize the resizing behaviour of rows and columns
of the layout and move, add, delete or modify fields within the
<span class="keyword">Form View</span>.
You may toggle between the <span class="keyword">Form View</span> and the
<span class="keyword">Form Designer</span> by checking and unchecking
<span class="menu">Design Mode</span> in the popup menu, which appears upon
a right mouse click on the header area of the <span class="keyword">Form View</span>.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="help/img/views/designMode.jpeg"></p>
<p align="left">DataWarrior's forms and their items adapt automatically to the 
available space, which you notice when you resize the form or print it on different 
paper formats. This behaviour is achieved through a layout manager that works 
behind the scenes. The way in which the layout manager assigns the available 
space to form items works as follows: You may define a certain number of columns. 
The resizing behaviour of every column is defined by assigning one of these 
types: <span class="menu">Fixed Size</span>, <span class="menu">Relative Size</span> 
and <span class="menu">Share Remaining Space</span>. <span class="keyword">Fixed 
size columns</span> are served first. They get a fixed number of pixels from 
the available width. <span class="keyword">Relative size columns</span> are 
defined to get a certain percentage from the remaining width. What is left from 
the total width after all columns of these two kinds have claimed their part, 
is devided equally between the columns that are of type <span class="menu">Share 
Remaining Space</span>. Sharing the available height among all rows works in 
the same way. Columns and rows together define a grid which can then be used 
to attach form items. These may just occupy one grid cell or strech across multiple 
columns and rows. Typically rows or columns, which are used as borders or as 
spacing between form items are often defined as being of fixed size. Those that 
bear form items often share the remaining space.</p>
<p align="left">In the Form Designer you insert or remove colums or rows by means 
  of a popup menu which appears after a right mouse click on the appropriate lila 
  colored column or row header area.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="help/img/views/designModeColumnPopup.jpeg"></p>
<p align="left">This popup menu also allows to switch between the associated column 
  or row modes. If you need to remove many of a form's rows or columns this can 
  be quickly done by selecting them in the row or column header area and then 
  choosing <span class="menu">Remove Selected Columns</span> from the popup menu. 
  When you remove columns or rows from a form then form items which are are positioned 
  exclusively in these rows or columns then these form items are removed as well.</p>
<p align="left">Form items may be introduced by right clicking into a light blue 
  cell of a form and selecting <span class="menu">Add &lt;field name&gt;</span> 
  from the popup menu. Form items may be repositioned by dragging them around 
  on the form's grid or by moving their edge and corner positions with the mouse. 
  A right mouse click onto a form icon opens a poopup menu that allows to assign 
  it to a different data field or to remove it entirely from the form.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="help/img/views/defaultForm.jpeg"></p>

<p>When all form editing is done, then you may leave the form designer by unchecking 
  the <span class="menu">Design Mode</span> option in the forms main view popup 
  menu.</p>

<h3><i><a name="StructureView"></a>The Structure View</i></h3>

<p>This view renders all molecules of a data column within a 2-dimensional grid.
The number of structures per row and with it the size of the structures may be adjusted
by right-clicking into the view and selecting <span class="menu">number of columns</span>
from the popup menu. The structure pictures may be decorated with further information from the same data row.
To do so choose <span class="menu">Show/Hide Label</span> from the same popup menu.
A dialog lets you assign column titles to predefined label positions around the chemical structure.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="help/img/views/structureView.jpeg" border="0"></p>

<p>The sort order of structures and the <span class="keyword">Structure Highlight Mode</span>
reflect the settings defined in the <span class="keyword">Table View</span>.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="help/img/views/dragAndDrop.jpeg"></p>
<p><b><span class="keyword">Structure Filter</span> TIP</b>: You can drag and drop a molecule from the
<span class="keyword">Structure View</span> to a <span class="keyword">Structure Filter</span>
or directly into the <span class="keyword">Structure Editor</span>.</p>
