<h2><a name="MachineLearning"></a>Machine Learning Methods</h2>
<hr align="left" size="2" width="550">

<p>Since a few years we see a remarkable hype about <span class="keyword">machine learning</span> and
<span class="keyword">artificial intelligence</span> in all sectors triggered by a successful
renaissance of convolutional neural networks in the field of image recognition. In just a few years before 2020
<a href="https://blog.benchsci.com/startups-using-artificial-intelligence-in-drug-discovery">about
200 startup companies</a> have been founded applying 'artificial intelligence' for drug discovery.
This development is fueled by large amounts of money invested by pharmaceutical companies being afraid
of missing the departing train. In some cases QSAR approaches, which are established and applied since two
decades, are now renamed to artificial intelligence and successfully commercialized as expensive panacea
for the future. At the same time new promising approaches arise, e.g. the usage of deep neural networks
to quickly and accurately estimate quantum chemical energies and forces.</p>

<p>Machine learning methods fall into two broad categories, <span class="keyword">unsupervised</span> and
<span class="keyword">supervised</span> ones. Unsupervised methods take properties of the data as input
information and infere that there are multiple different classes without knowing anything else from the data.
Or they may arrange objects in multiple dimensions according to perceived object similarity in a linear
or non-linear fashion. These unsupervised learning algorithms have a wide range of applications and solve
real world problems such as anomaly detection, document grouping, patient segmentation, or finding compounds
with common properties. The following methods fall into the <span class="keyword">unsupervised learning</span>
category.</p>

<br>

<h3><a name="PCA"></a>Principal Component Analysis</h3>

<p><span class="keyword">The Principal Component Analysis</span>
(PCA) is a widely used technique to convert a large number of
highly correlated variables into a smaller number of less correlated variables. De-facto it does
a coordinate transformation and re-positions the first axis of the coordinate system such that it perceives
the maximum possible variance of the multidimensional data. Then the second axis is positioned orthogonal
to the first one such that it perceives the maximum possible variance of the remaining dimensionality.
The third axis is again positioned orthogonal to the first two also maximizing the perceived variance
of the remaining data and so forth. In reality, to not overvalue those dimension with the highest numerical
values, <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> normalizes and centers the values of every input dimension
before applying the coordinate transformation.</p>

<p>Often the first dimensions (or components) of a PCA cover much of the variability of the data.
This is because in reality many dimensions of multi-dimensional data are often highly correlated.
In chemical data sets, for instance, carbon atom count, ring count, molecular surface, hetero atom count
are all highly correlated with the molecular weight and therefore almost redundant information.
Often the first two or three dimensions taken from a PCA can be used to position the objects on a plane
or in space such that clusters of similar objects can easily be recognized in the view.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="help/img/ml/pca.jpeg"></p>

<p>Since many chemical descriptors are nothing else then binary or numerical vectors, one can
consider the n dimensions of these vectors as n parameters of the data set. Therefore, the binary
and SkeletonSpheres descriptors can be selected as parameters to the PCA. This allows to visualise
chemical space, if the first calculated components are assigned to the axes of a coordinate system.
In the example above a dataset of a few thousand Cannabinoid receptor antagonists from the ChEMBL database
was used to calculate the first three principal components from the <span class="keyword">SkeletonSpheres</span>
descriptor. These were assigned to the axes of a 3D-view. The dataset was clustered with the same descriptor
joining compounds until cluster similarity reached 80%, forming more than 300 clusters.
Marker colors were set to represent cluster numbers. The distinct areas of equal color are evidence
of the chemical space separation that can be achieved by a PCA, even though the dataset consists of rather
diverse structures.</p>
<br>

<h3><a name="TSNE"></a>t-SNE Visualization</h3>

<p>T-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) is a machine learning algorithm for visualization
developed by Laurens van der Maaten and Geoffrey Hinton. It is a nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique
well-suited for embedding high-dimensional data for visualization in a low-dimensional space of two or three
dimensions. Specifically, it models each high-dimensional object by a two- or three-dimensional point in such
a way that similar objects are modeled by nearby points and dissimilar objects are modeled by distant points
with high probability.</p>

<p>L.J.P. van der Maaten. <i>Accelerating t-SNE using Tree-Based Algorithms.</i> Journal of Machine Learning Research <b>15</b> (2014), 3221-3245.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="help/img/ml/tsne.jpeg"></p>
<p align="center"><i>Typical visualization of a 2-dimensional t-SNE plot with about 20.000 data points</i></p>

<p>The t-SNE calculation used in DataWarrior is based on the Java code developed in 2016 by Leiff Jonsson at
  Delft University of Technology. The source code is publicly available at https://github.com/lejon/T-SNE-Java.</p>

<p>If you choose many input dimensions, especially if you select a chemical descriptor as input,
than <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> may use a principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality
to a lower number before applying the t-SNE algorithm. The <span class="menu">Source dimensions</span>
parameter defines the maximum number of dimensions passed to the t-SNE algorithm. If your selected source columns
contain more dimensions than this parameter, than a PCA is performed. Please note that a chemical descriptor alone
typically contains 512 or even 1024 dimensions.</p>

<p>DataWarrior uses the Barnes-Hut implementation with a default perplexity value of 20.0 and a maximum of 1000 iterations.
In addition to the number maximum number of t-SNE input dimensions, the perplexity value and the number of iterations
can be modified. A good overview of what these parameters mean and how they influence the outcome is available from
<a href="https://distill.pub/2016/misread-tsne/">Martin Wattenberg et al</a>.</p>
<br>

<h3><a name="UMAP"></a>UMAP Visualization</h3>

<p>UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) is dimension reduction algorithm that is often used as
alternative to t-SNE because of various advantages. It was first described by L. McInnes, J. Healy, and J. Melville in
<a href="https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1802.03426">https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1802.03426</a>. UMAP is summarized by
the authors as <i>UMAP is constructed from a theoretical framework based in Riemannian geometry and algebraic topology.
The result is a practical scalable algorithm that applies to real world data. The UMAP algorithm is competitive with
t-SNE for visualization quality, and arguably preserves more of the global structure with superior run time performance.
Furthermore, UMAP has no computational restrictions on embedding dimension, making it viable as a general purpose dimension
reduction technique for machine learning.</i></p>

<p>As t-SNE, UMAP can be used visualize multi-dimensional space, which in the case of <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span>
can be chemical space. Thus, all chemical descriptors, which are vectors, can be used as input dimensions in addition to
or without any other numerical columns. <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> uses the UMAP implementaion for Java
by Sean A. Irvine and Richard Littin.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="help/img/ml/umap.jpeg" width="583" height="465"></p>
<p align="center"><i>2D-UMAP visualization of >3000 molecules using the SkeletonSpheres descriptor; color by structure classes</i></p>

<p>The algorithm's parameters, which are available to the user, are as follows:</p>

<p><b>Nearest neighbors</b> Larger values result in more global views of the manifold, while smaller values result in
more local data being preserved. Generally in the range of 3 to 1000. The reported default is 15, but it seems that
in the context of molecules larger values often result in better results.</p>
<p><b>Target dimensions</b> is typically 2 or 3 to provide easy visualization, but can reasonably be set to any integer value
in the range of 2 to 100.</p>
<p><b>Minimum distance</b> influences the desired separation between close points in the embedding space.
Smaller values will result in a more clustered/clumped embedding where nearby points on the manifold are drawn closer
together, while larger values will result on a more even disperse of points. The value should be smaller than 1.0,
which is the algorithm's <i>spread</i> value that determines the scale at which embedded points will be spread out.
The default reported default value is 0.1, but larger values seem to achieve better local resolution. Therefore, we
use a default of 0.5.</p>
<p><b>Metric</b> controls how distance is computed in the ambient space of the input data. By default, UMAP uses
an euclidian metric.</p>
<br>


<h3><a name="SOM"></a>Self-Organizing Maps</h3>
<p>
A <span class="keyword">Self-Organizing Map</span> (SOM) also called
<span class="keyword">Kohonen Map</span>
is a popular and robust artificial neural network algorithm to organize objects based on object
similarity. Typically, this organization happens in 2-dimensional space. For this reason SOMs
can be used well to visualize the similarity relationsships of hundreds or thousands of
objects of any kind. Historically, small SOMs (e.g. 10*10) were used in cheminformatics
to cluster compounds by assigning similar compounds to the same neuron. A typical visualization
showed the grid with every grid cell colored to represent number of cluster members or an
averidge property value. In order to visualize individual compounds of the chemical space
<i>DataWarrior</i> uses many more neurons and adds a sub-neuron resolution explained in the
following.</p>

<p>Similar to the PCA, the SOM algorithm uses multiple numerical object properties,
e.g. of a molecule, which together define an object specific n-dimensional vector.
The vector may either consist of numerical column values
or - as with the PCA - it may be a chemical descriptor. These object describing vectors are called
input vectors, because their values are used to train a 2-dimensional grid of equally sized,
but independent reference vectors (also called neurons).<br>
The goal of the training is to incrementally optimize the values of the reference vectors
such that eventually
<ul><li>every input vector has at least one similar counterpart in the set of reference vectors.</li>
<li>adjacent reference vectors in the rectangular grid are similar to each other.</li></ul>
The final grid of reference vectors should represent a rectangular area of smoothly changing
property space, where every input vector can be assigned to a similar reference vector.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="help/img/ml/som.jpeg"></p>
<p align="center"><i>Cannabinoid receptor antagonists on a SOM with 50x50 neurons</i></p>

<p>The Cannabinoid receptor antagonists, which have been used in the PCA example, were
arranged on a SOM considering the <i>SkeletonShperes</i> descriptor as similarity criterion.
The background colors of the view visualize neighborhood similarity of adjacent neurons
in landscape inspired colors. Blue to green colors indicate valleys of similar neurons,
while yellow to orange areas show ridges of more abrupt changes of the chemical space
between adjacent neurons. Colored markers are located above the background landscape
on top of those neurons, which represent the compound descriptors best. This way very
similar compounds huddle in same valleys, while slightly different cluster are separated
by yellow ridges.<br>
Please note that <i>DataWarrior</i> uses sub-neuron-resolution to position object on
the final SOM. After assigning an object to the closest reference vector, any object's
position is fine-tuned by the object's similarity to the adjacent neurons.</p>

<p>Comparing the SOM to the PCA concerning their ability to visualize chemical space,
SOMs have these advantages: SOMs use all available space, while PCAs leave parts of the
available area or space empty. The SOM takes and translates exact similarity values,
while the PCA uses two or three principal components only to separate objects and,
therefore, may miss some distinction criteria. High compound similarity is translated
well into close topological neighborhood on the SOM. However, vicinity on the SOM
does not necessarily imply object similarity, because close neurons may be separated by
ridges and represent different areas of the chemical space, especially if the number
of reference vectors is low. One may also check how well individual objects match
the reference vectors they are assigned to. For this purpose <i>DataWarrior</i>
calculates for every row a <i>SOM_Fit</i> value, which is the square root of the
dissimilarity between the row's input vector and the reference vector the row is
assigned to. As a rule of thumb, <i>SOM_Fit</i> values below 0.5 are a good indication
of a well separating SOM.</p>

<p>The SOM algorithm is a rather simple and straightforward one. First the input vectors
are determined and normalized to avoid distortions of different numerical scales.
The number of values stored in each input vector equals the number of numerical columns
selected or the number of dimensions of the chosen descriptor.
Then a grid of n*n reference vectors is initialized with random numbers.
The reference vectors have the same dimensionality as the input vectors.<br>
Then a couple of thousand times the following procedure is repeated:
In input vector is selected randomly. That reference vector is located, which
is most similar to the input vector. This reference vector and the reference vectors in
its circular neighborhood are modified to make them a little more similar to
the selected input vector. The amount of the modification decreases with increasing
distance from the central reference vector and it decreases with the number of
modification rounds already done. This way a coarse grid structure is formed quickly,
while the more local manifestation of fine-granular details takes the majority of the
optimization cycles.</p>

To create a SOM from any data set in <i>DataWarrior</i> select
<span class="menu">Create...</span> from the <span class="menu">Self Organizing Map</span>
submenu of the <span class="menu">Data</span> menu. The following dialog appears:

<p align="center"><img src="help/img/ml/somDialog.jpeg"></p>

<p><b>Parameters used:</b> The columns selected here define the similarity criterion
between objects or table rows. All values are normalized by the variance of the column.
The normalized row values of all selected columns form the vector, which is used
to calculate an euclidian similarity to other row's vectors. If a chemical
descriptor is selected here, the SOM uses respective chemical similarities and,
thus, can be used to visualize chemical space.</p>

<p><b>Neurons per axis:</b> This defines the size of the SOM. As a rule of thumb
the total number of neurons (square the chosen value) should about match the
number of rows. A highly diverse dataset will require some more neurons, while
a highly redundant combinatorial library will be fine with less.</p>

<p><b>Neighbourhood function:</b> This selects the shape of the curve, which defines
how the factor for neuron modification factor decreases with distance from the
central neuron. The typical shape is a <span class="menu">gaussean</span> one,
which usually causes smooth SOMs.</p>

<p><b>Grow map during optimization:</b> Large SOMs take quite some time for the
algorithm to finish. One way of reducing the time is to start out with a much smaller
SOM and double the size of each axis three time during the optimization. If
this option is checked, the map starts with one eightht of the defined neurons
per axis.</p>

<p><b>Create unlimited map:</b> If this option is checked, then the left edge neurons
of the grid are considered to be connected to the respective right edge neurons
and top edge neurons are considered to be connected to bottom edge neurons.
This effectively converts the rectangular area to the surface of a torus,
which has no edges anymore and, therefore, avoids edge effects during the
optimization phase.</p>

<p><b>Fast best match finding:</b> A large part of the calculation time is spent
on finding the most similar neuron to a randomly picked input vector.
If this option is checked, then best matching neurons are cached
for every input vector and are used in later as best match searches as
starting point. This assumes that a path with steadily increasing similarity
exists from the previous best matchin neuron to the current one.</p>

<p><b>Show vector similarity landscape in background:</b> After finishing the
SOM algorithm, <i>DataWarrior</i> creates a 2-dimensional view displaying
the objects arranged by similarity. If this option is checked, a background
picture is automatically generated, which shows the neighbourhood similarity
of the SOMs reference vectors in colors inspired by landscape. Blue, cyan, green,
yellow, orange and red reflect an increasing dissimilarity between adjacent
neurons. Markers in the same blue or green valley belong to rather
similar objects.</p>

<p><b>Use pivot table:</b> This option allows to pivot the data on the fly.
Imagine a dataset where gene expression values have been determined for a number
of genes in some different tissues. The results are stored in three columns
with gene names, expression values, and tissue types. For
<span class="menu">Group by:</span> you would select <i>Tissue Type</i>
and for <span class="menu">Split data by:</span> <i>Gene Name</i>.
<i>DataWarrior</i> would then convert the table layout to yield one
<i>Tissue Type</i> column and one additional column with expression values
for every gene name. The generated SOM would then show similarities between
tissue types considering expression values of multiple genes.</p>

<p><b>Save file with SOM vectors:</b> Use this option to save all reference
vectors to a file once the optimization is done. Such a file can be used
later to map objects from a different dataset to the same map, provided
that they contain the properties or descriptor used to train the SOM.
One might, for instance, train a large SOM from many diverse compounds
containing both, mutagenic and non-mutagenic structures. If one would use
the SOM file to later map a commercial screening library, one could merge
both files and show toxic and non toxic areas by coloring the background
of a 2D-view accordingly. The foreground might show the compounds of the
screening library distributed in toxic and non-toxic regions.</p>

<h3><a name="Predictivity"></a>Assessing A Machine Learning Method's Predictivity</h3>

<p>The unsupervised methods above were used to reduce the dimensionality of data,
to classify or cluster rows based on feature commonalities, or simply to visualize the
data space in two dimensions. This section now uses supervised machine learning methods,
to build and train models from existing molecules and their properties. These
models shall then be used to predict the same properties for new molecules.
For this purpose <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> uses a support vector
machine (SVM), the k-nearest neighbours (kNN) approach, a partial least squares
(PLS) regression, or the Power-PLS, which is a PLS modification that supports non-linear
relationships.</p>

<p>Common to these methods is that they all build a model from given numerical X- and Y-values.
Later this model can be used to predict Y-values from new X-values. X-values in this regard
are multiple alpha-numerical or purely numerical values that describe the object
and the Y-value (also called label) is an object property that is either used for model learning
or is predicted by the final model for objects that where not used during training.
In the case of drug discovery the object might be a molecule,
X-values might be some structure descriptors and the Y-value might be some experimental value,
e.g. a physico-chemical property or a biological effect.<p>

<p>Evident pitfalls for applying machine learning methods in drug discovery for the prediction
of biological effects of chemical structures are manyfold:
<il>
<li>These methods were developed for areas, where objects are characterized by numerical values,
like historical stock data, gene expression values, pixel color values, etc. Molecules, however,
consist of 3-dimensional graphs. Their biological properties depend on conformational flexibility
and conformer interactions with target proteins. Machine learning methods cannot directly digest
molecules as X-values. Their X-values need to be vectors, i.e. lists of numerical values.
Therefore, molecular descriptors are calculated from the molecular structure and used as surrogate
in the hope that they describe a molecule well enough for these methods to work.</li>
<li>2D-descriptor bits encode the presence or absense of small fragments, but not their 3-dimensional
orientation in space. Also, conformational flexibility is not represented.</li>
<li>Most descriptors are folded (i.e. hashed), which means that the same bit encodes very different
fragments for different molecules, making it unlikely that descriptor patterns are predictive throughout
diverse structure classes.</li>
<li>In drug discovery, typically there is not much training data for a particular property.</li>
<li>If training data comes from different sources, it is often noisy and not very reliable.</li>
</il>
</p>Nevertheless, there is quite some demand for the prediction of biological properties from
the chemical structure. Given the many pitfalls, it is prudent to apply some skepticism and apply
sound validation checks to determine, whether a method can be applied for a given problem.</p>

<p>In fields outside of drug discovery it is common to assess the predictivity of a machine
learning method in two steps. First a random subset of data is taken to train a model from X- and Y-data.
Then, the model is used to predict Y-values for the remaining data. The correlation between predicted
and known Y-values gives a measure for the model's predictivity for new data. This works well,
if the data used is evenly distributed in X-value space and if new unknown objects can also be placed
within the boundaries of the X-value training space. For typical drug discovery datasets both conditions
are not given. Molecules tend to come in clusters of very similar structures and new molecules are often
very different from the ones used before. Therefore, a random cross-validation from molecules
with known properties results in over-optimistic correlations, because a random selection ensures
that every test set molecule has few very similar ones in the training set, originating from
the same cluster. More realistic results are achieved, if molecules are ordered along the time
axis, e.g. using the synthesis date. If then all molecules before a certain date are used for
model training and the newer ones for model validation, one may hope that obtained correlation values
can be repeated with the next set of molecules being synthesized for the same project.</p>

<p><span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> offers a convenient way to quickly assess, whether a
certain machine learning method may achieve a reasonable predictivity for a given property,
using a specific descriptor in a certain chemical space. For this it uses a time-based model
validation as decribed above. The dataset is divided into ten fractions along the time axis.
A model is build with the first fraction and used to predict the property of the second fraction's
molecules. Then a second model is built from the first two fractions, which is then applied to
predict the third fraction. This continues until the nineth model is built from the first nine fractions
and used to predict the tenth and last fraction. Correlation plots are generated for all nine models,
which show known versus predicted Y-values along with the calculated correlation coefficient.
The correlation plots and coefficients provide a solid basis to decide, whether it makes sense
to employ the chosen descriptor and method to predicts the property for new molecules.</p>

<p>To start the assessment for a given dataset first make sure that you have generated the descriptor,
which you intend to use and then select <span class="menu">Assess Prediction Quality...</span>
from the <span class="menu">Chemistry->Machine Learning</span> menu. The following dialog opens.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="help/img/ml/assessmentDialog.jpeg" width=286 height=308></p>
<p><center><i>The dialog for configuring the 'Assess Prediction Quality' task.</i></center></p>

<p><b>Structure column</b> and <b>Descriptor:</b> Here you select the descriptor type of the chemical
structure column that serves as independent variable to build the machine learning model.</p>

<p><b>Value column:</b> This selects the dependent variable, i.e. the property that
is used to train the model and that shall be predicted later.</p>

<p><b>Prediction method:</b> This is the machine learning method that is used.
<span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> supports four well known methods. The
<span class="keyword">kNN regression</span> method is a simple, but robust method that
locates the most similar neighbors and creates a weighted mean value as prediction.
The <span class="keyword">PLS</span> (partial least squares) method is basically a multi-linear
regression, which expects a linear dependency of the predicted variable and normality of the data.
The <span class="keyword">Power-PLS</span> method is a PLS with a preceeding
<span class="keyword">Box Cox</span> transformation, which opens the PLS for nolinear
relationsships and non normal distributed data.
The <span class="keyword">SVM</span> (support vector machine) is a robust mathematical approach
for non linear data that was believed for a long time to outperform any multi-layered neural networks.
More detailled descriptions of the methods are beyond the scope of this manual,
but can be easily found on the internet.</p>

<p><b>Method parameters:</b> After selecting a method this text field contains default
parameter settings for the method. Typically, these are not touched. However, if you know, what
you are doing, you may fine-tune the method by changing individual parameters here.</p>

<p><b>Time, date, or ID-column:</b> As described above, all rows are assigned to the ten data fractions
according to their position on the time axis. Thus, here a column should be selected
that ideally contains the creation or measurement date of the value. Often this is not available
and the synthesis date of the molecule or even its ID can be used as a proxy.</p>

<p><b>Use random fractions instead of time based ones:</b> This option causes random assignments
of rows to the ten fractions neglecting any selected time column. Since random cross-validations
produce over-optimistic correlations for chemical property predictions, this option should be used
with care.</p>

<p>After clicking <span class="menu">OK</span> the dialog closes, the data is devided into ten
fractions, nine prediction models are generated and used to predict the dependent variable.
A view is created that shows nine correlation plots, one for every model.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="help/img/ml/mlPotential.jpeg" width=680 height=466></p>
<p><center><i>Nine correlation plots show the predictivity of an SVM using SkeletonSpheres descriptors
to predict hERG activity for a given dataset of structurally related compounds devided in fractions along
the time axis.</i></center></p>

<p>Looking at these plots it is up to the scientist to decide, whether the achieved correlation is sufficiently
high to serve a a useful guidence in a drug discovery project.</p>
<br>

<h3><a name="MissingValues"></a>Predicting Missing Values</h3>

<p>If a data set with molecules contains numerical values for some of the molecules, then
<span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> can easily predict the missing values using a supervised
machine learning method and a chosen descriptor of the molecule. While it is easy to generate numbers
this way, it is advisable before predicting values to assess, whether the chosen machine learning method
within the given molecular structure space is able to achieve a predictivity that is sufficiently above
random guessing, which is described in the previous section.</p>
<p>In order to predict missing values, simply select <span class="menu">Predict Missing Values...</span>
from the <span class="menu">Chemistry->Machine Learning</span> menu. A dialog opens that lets you choose
a chemical structure column, a descriptor, a column that has missing numerical values, and a machine learning
method. For a descriptor to show up in the list, it must have been calculated before and it must be a
vector, i.e. it must be one of these: FragFp, PathFp, ShpereFp, SkeletonSpheres. As described in the
previous section, every machine learning method has some parameters, that influence the algorithm.
<span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> uses default parameters, which have been proven to work
reasonably well, but if you know what you are doing, you may experiment with the parameters by
adapting them in the dialog.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="help/img/ml/predictionDialog.png" width=259 height=249></p>
<p><center><i>The dialog for configuring the 'Predict Missing Values' task.</i></center></p>

<p>When the dialog is closed by pressing <span class="menu">OK</span>,
<span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> builds a model form the selected descriptor and
existing values in the chosen value column. Then it applies the model to fill all empty cells
in the values column with predicted values using the model and the structure descriptors
of the respective rows.</p>
